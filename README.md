## Project Description

This is a desktop application designed to help educators and students quickly generate practical programming assignments. The application takes a topic or notes as input (either typed in or uploaded as a PDF) and uses the Gemini AI model to create an assignment with two questions: one easy and one intermediate. The generated assignment can then be downloaded as a PDF. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface with a light/dark theme toggle.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* CustomTkinter (for the GUI)
* Google Generative AI (Gemini)
* fpdf (for PDF generation)
* PyPDF2 (for PDF text extraction)

## Steps to Run/Execute the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    * Python 3.8 or higher
    * Ensure you have `pip` installed.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    * Clone the repository to your local machine.
    * Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
    * Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

        ```bash
        pip install customtkinter google-generativeai fpdf PyPDF2
        ```
    ### **I currently have added a free api key which might stop working. If faculty want an api key for testing in case the current key actually stopped working they can mail me at theniteshsolanki@gmail.com**

3.  **Set up API Key:**

    * Locate the line in `main.py` that says:

        ```python
        genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")  # Replace with your actual API key
        ```
    * Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key.

4.  **Run the Application:**

    * In the same terminal, run the following command:

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
    * The application window will appear.

5.  **How to Use the Application:**

    * **Upload PDF:** Click the "Upload Notes PDF" button to upload a PDF file containing your notes. The text from the PDF will be extracted and placed in the topic entry.
    * **Enter Topic/Notes:** Type your topic or notes directly into the "Enter Topic or Paste Notes..." text entry field.
    * **Generate Assignment:** Click the "‚öôÔ∏è Generate Assignment" button. The application will use the Gemini API to generate an assignment based on your input. The generated assignment will be displayed in the text box.
    * **Download PDF:** Once the assignment is generated, the "üíæ Download as PDF" button will become enabled. Click it to save the assignment to a PDF file.
    * **Switch Theme:** Click the "Switch Theme üåó" button to toggle between light and dark mode.
